# BlindsQuotationSystem
This system is designed for a blinds company who still uses the traditional pen and paper method to do their quotations. This system will heavily speed up this process and make the employees work more efficiently.

The system will do the following:

1) Generate quotations much easier

2) Check the status of quotations, orders, and products being produced

3) Store client and order details into a database

4) Enable employees to check on supplier status and escalate things if necessary
